      Hi! Thank you for reviewing my CV! <br />
      My name is Szymon, and I&#39;ve been actively working on my professional growth as a Frontend Developer for more than 3 years. I never
      thought that after 10 years of working as a team manager, I would find a new passion that would completely change my career path.
